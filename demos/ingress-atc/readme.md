# Demo Ingress-ATC

This demo is a continuation of the ingress demo.

The goal is to demonstrate the lift needed to deploy an application server-side using the Air Traffic Controller.

This example aims to stay as close as possible to what was done in the original Ingress demo in code and implementation,
but we will instead extend our local cluster with a new resource type: `Backends.examples.com`.
